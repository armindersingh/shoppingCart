==============================================================================

Note : I have designed this in 2 and a half hours only.
1) This project includes all the functionality(adding to cart, removing from Cart, filtering based on color or brand).
2) Css has to be improved.
3) Need to work on state management more, some edge cases like uncheck the selected filtered checkboxes after doing new search for products and show all items added to cart as selected when user search for some other product. State for Cart has to be handled.
4) Took 2 and a half hours to finish this whole task, hope you would like it.(Could not get more time due to busy schedule at office).
